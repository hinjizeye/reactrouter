                The phosphate resources of Zambia have over the years attracted a great
                deal of attention as a possible source of fertiliser raw materials. Research has
                focused upon five igneous deposits, where the main phosphate mineral
                (apatite) occurs in carbonatite or syenite, or in associated pegmatites.

                Carbonate rocks are known to occur throughout Zambia, especially along the
                line of rail from Livingstone to North-Western Province, as well as in Luapula,
                Northern and Eastern provinces. Most of the carbonates occur in the clastic
                sequences of the Katanga Supergroup, with a smaller proportion in the older
                underlying Basement Complex and younger Karoo sequences. The CaO and
                MgO contents of several carbonates are given in Table 6.

                Silica sand of varying quality occurs throughout Zambia but no resource
                information exists except for that on the silica sand deposits near Kapiri
                Mposhi (which was the source of raw material for glass manufacture by Kapiri
                Glass products Ltd) and Rufunsa
