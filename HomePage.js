                The Republic of Zambia is a landlocked country in Southern-Central Africa (although some sources consider it part of East Africa). Its neighbors are the 
                Democratic Republic of the Congo to the north, Tanzania to the north-east, Malawi to the east, Mozambique to the southeast, Zimbabwe and Botswana to the 
                south, Namibia to the southwest, and Angola to the west. The capital city is Lusaka, located in the south-central part of Zambia. The population is
                 concentrated mainly around Lusaka in the south and the Copper-belt Province to the northwest, the core economic hubs of the country.

                On 24 October 1964, Zambia became independent of 
                the United Kingdom and Prime Minister Kenneth Kaunda became
                the inaugural president. Kaunda’s socialist United National Independence Party (UNIP) maintained power from 1964 until 1991. Kaunda played a key role
                 in regional diplomacy, cooperating closely with the United States in search of solutions to conflicts in Rhodesia (Zimbabwe), Angola, and Namibia. 
                 From 1972 to 1991 Zambia was a one-party state with the UNIP as the sole legal political party under the motto “One Zambia, One Nation”. Dr. Kaunda
                  was succeeded by Frederick Chiluba of the social-democratic Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) in 1991, beginning a period 
                of social-economic growth and government decentralization.
